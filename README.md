# Cherrymap
Import Nmap scans to Cherrytree

Useful script to assist you during infrastructure assessments, importing to Cherrytree (https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/) results of Nmap scans.

Note that both XML and .nmap files have to be present in the same folder. We recommend using the option `-oA file2save` when doing the scan. 


## Merging options

This utility can merge the nmap scan inside another CherryTree file. **This file must be a non-protected XML file, otherwise ths utility won't work !**. 
In case of merging the data into another CherryTree file (`-m` option), the utility will insert it as last node, with the filename as node name. 

You can convert any other format by opening it in CherryTree, then clicking on `Export` > `Export to CherrtyTree document` and select `XML, Not protected (.ctd)`.

## Requirements

 - `lxml`
 - `python-libnmap`
